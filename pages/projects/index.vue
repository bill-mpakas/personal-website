        <p class="content__main">
          When I was young I had this dream about becoming a pro skateboarder. 
          I was the first to be at the skate park every day and the last to leave. 
          I would spend every day pushing myself to become better and better. 
          Sadly, I didn’t manage to become a pro skateboarder, but what I did learn from skateboarding is the consistent work it takes to be good at something – knowledge I apply to the professional work I do now.
